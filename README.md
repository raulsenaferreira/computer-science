## About

Adaptação do repositório original, aplicado ao curso de ciência da computação da UFRRJ com o intuito de montar uma base de conhecimento, tanto de material quanto de código, dos próprios alunos que cursam essas matérias.

Repositório ainda em fase experimental e que ainda precisa sofrer alterações e talvez, algumas mudanças como tradução entre outras coisas.

## Becoming an OSS student

To officially register for this course you must create a profile in our [Perfil dos estudantes](https://github.com/raulsenaferreira/computer-science/issues/1) issue.

> **"How can I do this?"**

Comment in [this](https://github.com/raulsenaferreira/computer-science/issues/1) issue  (please, do **not** open a new one) using the following template:

```
- **Name**: YOUR NAME
- **GitHub**: [@your_username]()
- **Twitter**: [@your_username]()
- **Linkedin**: [link]()
- **Website**: [yourblog.com]()

## Completed Courses

**Name of the Section**

Course|Files
:--|:--:
Course Name| [link]()
```

**IMPORTANT**: add your profile **only once** and **after** you **finish** each course you can **return** to that issue and **update** your comment.

**ps**: In the *Completed Courses* section, you should link the repository that contains the files that you created in the respective course.

> **"Why should I do this?"**

By making a [public commitment](http://renewablewealth.com/articles/the-power-of-a-public-commitment/), we have a greater chance of **successfully** graduating, a way to get to know our peers better, and an opportunity to share the things that we have done.

That is why we are using this strategy.

## Motivation & Preparation

Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", that consists in learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

- [MIT Challenge](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)

The second link is a MOOC course that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. This is a **fundamental ability** to succeed in our journey.

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the **Introduction** section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.

**If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**

### Should I take all courses?

**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here!

### Duration of the project

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular CS course, but I can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

> See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

### Project Based

Here in **OSS University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **"startup project"**.

> "What does it mean?"

After finish a course, you should think about a **real problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

The projects of all students will be listed in [this](projects.md) file. Submit your project's informations in that file after you conclude it.

**You can create this project alone or with other students!**

> Some project suggestions [here](https://github.com/karan/Projects) and [here](https://github.com/ericdouglas/app-specs).

And you should also...

### Be creative!

This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate. **And this is what really matters**!

In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

Here are some tips about how you can do that:

- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

### Cooperative work

**We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

### Which programming languages should I use?

My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use **any** language that you want to complete the courses.

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Content Policy

You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

[Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:

### Stay tuned

[Watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) this repository for futures improvements and general information.

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)
- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

**ps**: You don't need to do all of the courses. Just pick one and learn the basics because you will learn more on the go!

## Change Log

**Curriculum Version**: `1.1.0`

To show **respect** to all of our students, we will keep a [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file that contains all the alterations that our curriculum may suffer.

Now we have a **stable** version of the curriculum, which won't change anymore, only in exceptional cases (outdated courses, broken links, etc).

Our students can **trust** in this curriculum because it has been **carefully planned** and covers **all** the **core topics** that a conventional Computer Science course covers.

We also include modern topics, making this course one of the **best options** for those who want to become a Computer Scientist and/or a Software Engineer.

## How to collaborate

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this guide, or what we can do to improve the learning experience.

You can also fork this project and fix any mistakes that you have found.

Let's do it together! =)
